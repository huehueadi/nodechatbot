A dynamic QR code is a type of QR code that can be edited or updated even after it's been printed or shared. Unlike static QR codes, which embed permanent information (like a URL or text), dynamic QR codes point to a short URL that can redirect to different content or destinations. This makes them versatile and adaptable.

Features of Dynamic QR Codes:
Editable Content:

The destination URL or data can be changed without modifying the QR code itself.
Useful for campaigns, updated links, or changing content.
Trackable Analytics:

Track data like scan locations, number of scans, and device types.
Great for marketing campaigns to measure effectiveness.
Customizable Actions:

Dynamic QR codes can link to different actions like websites, forms, social media, videos, or downloadable files.
Password Protection:

Some dynamic QR code services allow password protection for added security.
